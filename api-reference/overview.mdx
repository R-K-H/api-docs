## Key Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="magnifying-glass" title="Automatic DAO Discovery">
    The API automatically discovers all DAOs from the Futarchy protocol without manual configuration. No need to maintain a list of DAOs - they're discovered dynamically from the blockchain.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="coins" title="Real-Time Pricing">
    Prices are calculated from spot pool reserves in real-time, accounting for token decimal differences to ensure accuracy.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="chart-bar" title="Volume Tracking">
    Trading volumes are calculated from accumulated protocol fees, providing accurate volume metrics that reflect actual trading activity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="droplet" title="Liquidity Metrics">
    Comprehensive liquidity information for all pools, calculated in USD for easy comparison.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="bolt" title="High Performance">
    Built with Bun for exceptional performance, featuring intelligent caching (10s for tickers, 100s for metadata) and rate limiting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="shield" title="CoinGecko Compatible">
    Fully compatible with CoinGecko's DEX API specification, making integration seamless with existing tools and platforms.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage:

- **60 requests per minute** per IP address
- Returns `429 Too Many Requests` when limit is exceeded
- Rate limits reset at the start of each minute window

## Caching

The API uses intelligent caching to balance freshness with performance:

- **Tickers**: 10 seconds TTL
- **Token Metadata**: 100 seconds TTL (longer cache for static data)

## Data Sources

All data comes from on-chain sources:

1. **Solana Blockchain** - Pool reserves, DAO accounts, protocol fees
2. **Metaplex Token Metadata** - Token symbols, names, and metadata
3. **Spot Pools Only** - Prices calculated from spot pools, not conditional markets

<Warning>
  Prices are only calculated from spot pools, not conditional/futarchy pools, to ensure spot market accuracy.
</Warning>

## Response Format

All endpoints return JSON responses. Error responses follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "error": "Error message describing what went wrong"
}
```
